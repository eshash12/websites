        <p>In computing, source code, or simply code, is any collection of text, with or without comments, written using
            a human-readable programming language, usually as plain text. The source code of a program is specially
            designed to facilitate the work of computer programmers, who specify the actions to be performed by a
            computer mostly by writing source code.
            <br><br>
        <p>The source code is often transformed by an assembler or compiler into binary machine code that can be
            executed by the computer. The machine code is then available for execution at a later time.</p>

        Most application software is distributed in a form that includes only executable files. If the source code were
        included it would be useful to a user, programmer or a system administrator, any of whom might wish to study or
        modify the program.
        <br>
        Alternatively, depending on the technology being used, source code may be interpreted and executed directly.</p>
